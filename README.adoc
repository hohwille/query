The `mmm-query` project was indendet to create a cool infrastructure to dynamically build typesafe queries/DB-statements from your data-model.
This has meanwhile be re-designed and re-implemented as part of mmm-entity-bean (https://github.com/m-m-m/entity) with amazing results.
Therefore this repository has been archived and will be deleted soon.
